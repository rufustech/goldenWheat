# Hi, Welcome to the Golden Wheat Bakery

## Website Link here when set up.

This is a group project made by Rufaro, Mark, Gaberiel, Ethan and Carolina. We are a team of students working to create a fully functional website. We all attend SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology).

In this project we will be showcasing our knowledge of React, NextJS, and Tailwind. We have a backend repository that can be found here :

[Golden Wheat Bakery Backend](https://github.com/rufustech/CPNT-262-Golden-Wheat-Bakery-backend)

In our backend Rufaro, and Gabriel were out back end specialists. They worked with MongoDB, and got our database schemas set up and linked.
